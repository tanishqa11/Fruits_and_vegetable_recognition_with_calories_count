## Fruits and Vegetables Classification with Calorie Count  

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify fruits and vegetables based on images and provides their calorie count. The application is built with Streamlit to offer an interactive user interface for uploading images and viewing results.  

## Features  
- **Image Classification:** Accurately identifies fruits and vegetables using a CNN model.  
- **Calorie Information:** Displays calorie count for the classified item.  
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Built using Streamlit for a seamless experience.  
- **Real-Time Analysis:** Allows users to upload images and receive instant results.  

## Dataset  
The dataset used for training the CNN model is sourced from Kaggle:  
[Fruit and Vegetable Image Recognition Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kritikseth/fruit-and-vegetable-image-recognition).  

It contains images of various fruits and vegetables organized into labeled folders.  

## Requirements  
Install the following dependencies before running the application:  
```bash
pip install tensorflow
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
pip install streamlit
```
## How to Run  

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fruit-veg-classification.git
   cd fruit-veg-classification
   ```
   
3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash 
   pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. **Download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in the folder.**

4. **Start the Streamlit app:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

5. **Upload an image of a fruit or vegetable and view the classification results along with the calorie count.**

## Future Enhancements
- Add more nutritional information for classified items.
- Improve classification accuracy with a larger dataset.
- Deploy the app online for public use.
- Incorporate more fod items
